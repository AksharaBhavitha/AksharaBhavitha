## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This project is about predicting the rainfall using Machine Learning.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the amount of rainfall (in millimeters) for a given day based on historical weather data. The model should be able to provide accurate predictions that help decision-makers in agriculture, urban planning, and weather forecasting systems.

Dataset:

-> year: The year the data was recorded.
-> month: The month of the year.
-> day: The day of the month.
-> tempavg: The average temperature on that day (presumably in Â°C).
-> DPavg: The average dew point on that day (in Â°C).
-> humidity avg: The average humidity (in %).
-> SLPavg: The average sea-level pressure (in hPa).
-> visibilityavg: The average visibility (in km).
-> windavg: The average wind speed (in km/h).
-> Rainfall: The amount of rainfall recorded (in mm).

* Features: tempavg, DPavg, humidity avg, SLPavg, visibilityavg, windavg, and potentially the time-related features (year, month, day).
* Target: Rainfall (mm).

** The algorithm used in this project is Random Forest Regressor. This model is part of the ensemble learning methods and works by constructing multiple decision trees during training. The output is the average of the predictions made by the individual trees, which helps improve the model's accuracy and reduce overfitting.
